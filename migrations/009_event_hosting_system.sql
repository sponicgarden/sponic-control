{{excluded_spaces}}

## RENTAL PERIOD

The rental period is **{{event_date}}** from **{{event_start_time}}** to **{{event_end_time}}**.

## FEES

**Rental Fee:** Company agrees the venue will be offered for a single event on **{{event_date}}** for a cost of **{{rental_fee}}**.

**Reservation Fee:** A refundable **{{reservation_fee}}** reservation fee is due at time of reservation. This is not refundable if the event is canceled. If the event happens, this will be refunded along with any cleaning deposits.

**Cleaning & Damage Deposit:** A refundable damage waiver fee of **{{cleaning_deposit}}** is due upon booking, at least two weeks before the event. This fee is used to cover cleaning and maintenance of the rentals after the rental period. If any damage occurs, Company will first use the Cleaning and Maintenance Fee to repair. If the repair costs exceed the Damage Waiver fee, Client will be responsible for the amount in excess of the Cleaning and Maintenance Fee they already paid.

This fee will not be refunded if event is canceled less than 14 days before scheduled date.

After the event, the Client agrees to clean the house according to the following schedule of items for all areas used, and indicate which tasks have been completed afterwards and submit photos of each, prior to receiving the deposit refund.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YP3fq703lP91rBZ54ba2TSLXrzqgVzxPRCW3w8lzG9M/edit#gid=989989662

If the house is not cleaned, the company will hire a cleaner and deduct from the damage deposit, estimated around $150 but billed at the actual cost @ $30/hour + $30.

## GUEST LIMIT

Client agrees no more than **{{max_guests}} people** including volunteers and paid attendees will be attending, including people attending who live at the house. Client agrees to pay $15 fee per additional person, and agrees to candidly report attendance.

## WARRANTY DISCLAIMER

Client acknowledges that the rental property is of a size, design, and capacity selected by Client, and that Company disclaims all warranties express or implied with respect to the rental property, including any express or implied warranties as to condition, fitness for a particular purpose or durability.

## DAMAGED OR MISSING RENTAL ITEMS

Damages include, but are not limited to chipped, cracked or broken items, stained and dirtied upholstery or fabric that are beyond normal wear and tear, loss or damage due to theft, burglary, misuse, abuse, theft by conversion, intentional damage, disappearance, or loss due to Client''s failure to care for the Rental Items, including damage as a result of leaving Rental Items out in the rain or in a sprinkler system.

If Client discovers damaged or missing rental items prior to the start of the event, Client must notify Company immediately. As appropriate, Company will provide a replacement for any damaged or missing rental items prior to the event start time. If not possible to provide any replacements, the Company will refund the appropriate fee associated with the damaged/missing items. Damaged rental items shall not be used at the event. All damaged rental items remain the property of Company and must be returned to Company.

Any damages occurring after the Rental Items are delivered to Client, including damage occurring as a result of any person other than a Company representative moving the Rental Items from the location where they were placed by Company are the sole responsibility of Client, whether actually caused by Client or by Client''s guests, event venue staff, or third party event vendors.

**Inclement Weather:** Client further agrees to arrange effective provisions so that, in the event of rain or inclement conditions, goods will be shielded from the elements and/or protected from damage. Failure to plan for such contingency may result in Company not placing items outdoors such as furnishings. For any costs owed to the Company for any damage repair, Client shall remit payment to Company within 30 days following Company''s written request.

## PHOTOGRAPHY & BRANDING

Client agrees that any photography of their event at the Sponic Garden will not be publicly posted without permission. The name "Sponic Garden" will only be used in describing the location and not as a host of the event.

## INDEMNIFICATION

Client hereby voluntarily and expressly releases, indemnifies, forever discharges and holds harmless Company any and all liability, claims, demands, causes or rights of action whether personal to Client, including those allegedly attributed to negligent acts or omissions. Should Company or anyone on behalf of Company be required to incur attorney fees and costs to enforce this agreement, Client expressly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Company for all such fees and costs. In consideration of being permitted by Company to use its furniture, the undersigned agree to indemnify and hold harmless Company from any and all claims which are brought by the undersigned.

Client acknowledges and certifies that Client has had sufficient opportunity to read the entire Rental Agreement and understands its content, and Client executes it freely and without duress of any kind and agrees to the terms herein stated.
